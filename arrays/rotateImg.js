/* You are given an n * n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate
the image by 90 degrees. You have to rotate the image in-place, which
means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. Do not allocate another 
2D matrix and do the rotation. 
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1], [8,5,2], [9,6,3]]

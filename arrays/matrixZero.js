/* Given an m * n matrix. If an element is 0, set its
entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place. 
Follow up:
A straight forward solution using 0(mn) space is probably a 
bad idea. 
A simple improvement uses 0(m + n) space, but still not
the best solution. 
Could you devise a constant space solution?
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]
